      <li>Favorite verse: “Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence
        is in him. They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its
        roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green.
        It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.” Jeremiah 17:7-8 </li>
