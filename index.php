  <h3>About us</h3>
  <div class="intro">
    <p>   <img src="Images/mless.jpg" alt="mless group photo sp. 2017">
      Measureless is the fusion of two of Cornell's previous a cappella groups: the
      Atonements and Grace Notes, which have been around for well over a decade.
      With the aim of achieving greater unity in vision and voice, “Measureless”
      was formed. The name "Measureless" comes from the hymn "The Love of God," which
      describes God's love for us - His creation. In God's infinite love, He gave up
      his one and only son, Jesus Christ, to die for our sins so that we might be
      reconciled to Him. Therefore, the group's purpose is to glorify God in all things
      related to and outside a cappella. We aim to share the good news of salvation
      in Jesus Christ with the Cornell community and beyond through music and through
      the personal testimonies of God's power in our lives. In doing these things,
      we strive to draw nearer to God and take part in his awesome work.</p>

      <p>Our mission is to use our music as a medium to reach Cornell, that everyone might hear, discover,
        and receive the love of God.</p> <!--Mission statement found on facebook page-->
